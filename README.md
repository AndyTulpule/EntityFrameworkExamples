# EntityFrameworkExamples
Entity Frame work ASP.NET examples.
This is Contoso Unviversity Example liked hence want the code to be uploaded to repository branch I created.
I am trying to Merge the Branch. 
Steps I took 
1) Create a new Branch
2) Cloned the Branch using GitHub Desktop. When cloning on the desktop version you have to specify the physical path.
3) Copied the Entity Framework project to the physical path. This automatically uploaded the files to newly created branch.
4) Commited the changes to the new created branches. (2 to 4 I used Desktop version of GITHUB)
5) Merged the changes with the newly created branch with the Master Branch.
6) Deleted the newly created branch.

Branches are created so that you can modify the code, test your code and commit your code.
You can then merge it with the main branch. You can the delete the branch you create to avoid the complexity.
